Step 5

1) For the separate chaining, the time it takes to put an element in the table seems
to stay the same, since the separate chaining is implemented using a linked list, and
adding to the front of a linked list requires O(1) time. For the linear probing, the
time to put in an element goes up because if there is a collision, it takes O(n) to
put the value in the next empty spot. As more values are inserted in, it takes more
time to an empty spot, since there are less available spaces. For quadratic probing,
the time seems to stay the same, since the values end up less clustered together, so
finding an empty spot after a collision takes less time.

2) For all the table, when a collision occurs, it takes more time for the value to be put
in the table, since the function has to deal with this by adding it to the list, or finding
the next empty spot in the array.

3) Using 101 as the capacity creates less collisions, since 101 is a prime number,
and modding a value with a prime number creates less repeats.
